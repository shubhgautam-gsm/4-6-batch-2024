<h2>JavaScript For In Loop</h2>
<p>The for in statement loops through the properties of an object:</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
const person = {fname:"John", lname:"Doe", age:25}; //{key:value}  not having index

let txt = "";
//x='fname'
for (let x in person) { 
  txt += person[x] + " ";
}

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = txt;
</script>
