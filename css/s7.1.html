  <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  <!-- <img src="../../../9-11-batch-2024/images/feed-6.jpg" alt=""> -->

  <p>Here, the background image is only shown once. In addition it is positioned away from the text.</p>
  <p>In this example we have also added a margin on the right side, so that the background image will not disturb the text.</p>
  
</div>


<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you do not see any scrollbars, try to resize the browser window.</p>
